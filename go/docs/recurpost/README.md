# RecurPost API Docs

This repo includes a compiled OpenAPI spec for the RecurPost API at:

- `pkg/api/recurpost/openapi_new.yaml`

Quick view (HTML)

- Open `docs/recurpost/index.html` in a browser to view the schema rendered with ReDoc. It references the YAML spec via a relative path and works locally.

CI / Publishing (optional)

- You can publish the HTML file as a static page (e.g., GitHub Pages) or add a CI step to copy `openapi_new.yaml` alongside `index.html` on deploy.
