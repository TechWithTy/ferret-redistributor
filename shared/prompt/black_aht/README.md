## Black AHT Prompt Suite

This folder captures experimental prompts and scenarios for the “black_aht”
workflows. Use the nested directories to keep artifacts organized:

- `prompts/` – atomic POML snippets or reusable prompt fragments.
- `scenarios/` – higher level storyboards or orchestrations that stitch multiple
  prompts together.

Add new content in the corresponding subfolder and give each prompt a short
description at the top of the file. Avoid committing sensitive data; use the
`_mcp_deny` suffix if something must stay private to tooling.
