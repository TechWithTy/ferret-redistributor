    <step title="Pull Reports">
      - Use `python/google_analytics/client.py` (or MCP wrapper) to retrieve key funnels: acquisition → activation, landing page engagement, device splits.
      - Export segments for personas, content pillars, and campaign sources to align with experiment enums.
    </step>
    <step title="Diagnose Gaps">
      - Locate drop-offs (high bounce, low conversion) per platform/channel.
      - Capture hypotheses explaining each gap (e.g., CTA misalignment, slow load).
    </step>
    <step title="Design Variants">
      - Pair each hypothesis with Channels + Platforms specs.
      - Define Creative Assets/Scripts necessary to test improvements (e.g., new hero copy, faster page variant).
      - Attach KPIs from GA (conversion rate, engagement rate) to track in KPI Progress.
    </step>
  </workflow>

  <quality>
    - Reference report IDs / query parameters for reproducibility.
