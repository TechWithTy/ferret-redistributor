    <step title="Instrument KPIs">
      - For each experiment variant, confirm KPI definitions (source, owner, threshold) are linked.
      - Create or update ☃️ KPI Progress entries with experiment, KPI, platform, and current/goal values.
    </step>
    <step title="Monitor & Update">
      - Establish cadence (daily/weekly) to refresh KPI snapshots from analytics tools.
      - Update KPI Progress entries with the latest current value, notes, and status; record who edited it.
      - Capture qualitative signals (e.g., anomaly, attribution) in the notes field.
    </step>
    <step title="Alert & Escalate">
      - Flag KPIs that fall below threshold or exceed expectations; notify experiment owners.
      - If data gaps exist, coordinate with platform owners to remediate instrumentation.
    </step>
  </workflow>

  <quality>
    - No variant should remain without an associated KPI Progress row.
    - Use consistent units and timestamps for comparability.
