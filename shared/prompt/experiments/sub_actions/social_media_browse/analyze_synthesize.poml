        * Hypotheses to test (e.g., "Carousel posts with 5+ slides outperform single images").
        * Metrics to track for experiments.
        * Control and variant designs.
      - **Creative Direction**: 
        * Visual style recommendations.

    - Base insights on data: avoid assumptions without evidence.
    - Provide specific examples: reference actual posts that demonstrate patterns.
    - Consider context: what works for one audience may not work for another.
    - Identify causation vs. correlation: engagement doesn't always mean content caused it.
    - Be actionable: insights should lead to testable hypotheses.
    - Document methodology: explain how patterns were identified.
