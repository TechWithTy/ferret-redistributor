    <step title="Identify Target Platforms">
      - Review `platforms.toon` to understand platform constraints and capabilities.
      - Select platforms based on:
        * Target audience demographics and platform preferences.
        * Content type requirements (video, image, carousel, text).
        * Experiment goals (awareness, engagement, conversion).
        * Available MCP servers in `shared/mcp/config.public.json` or `config.private.json`.
    </step>

    <step title="Define Search Criteria">
      - **Tags/Hashtags**: 
        * Primary tags: core topics relevant to experiment or content pillar.
        * Secondary tags: related or complementary topics.
        * Competitor tags: hashtags used by similar accounts or brands.
      - **Keywords**: 
        * Terms to search in captions, descriptions, and comments.
        * Include synonyms, variations, and related terminology.
        * Consider platform-specific language and slang.
      - **Mentions**: 
        * Specific accounts, brands, or influencers to monitor.
        * Related accounts in the same niche or industry.
    </step>

    <step title="Apply Filters">
      - **Date Range**: 
        * Time window for content discovery (e.g., last 30 days, last quarter).
        * Consider seasonality and trending periods.
      - **Media Type**: 
        * Filter by format: image, video, carousel, reel, story, etc.
        * Match format to experiment requirements.
      - **Engagement Thresholds**: 
        * Minimum likes, comments, shares, or views.
        * Engagement rate thresholds (e.g., >2% engagement rate).
      - **User Filters**: 
        * Verified accounts only (for credibility).
        * Follower count ranges (micro-influencers vs. macro-influencers).
        * Account types: creator, brand, personal, business.
    </step>

    <step title="Set Relevance Criteria">
      - Define what makes content "relevant":
        * Topic alignment: how closely content matches target themes.
        * Engagement quality: authentic vs. purchased engagement.
        * Recency: how important is timeliness for this research.
        * Audience match: content that resonates with target persona.
      - Document relevance scoring approach for ranking phase.
    </step>

    <step title="Document Search Strategy">
      - Record all search parameters for reproducibility.
      - Note platform-specific considerations (API limits, authentication needs).
      - Create search query log template for tracking results.
    </step>
  </workflow>

  <quality>
    - Be specific: vague search terms yield irrelevant results.
    - Consider platform differences: hashtag usage varies by platform.
    - Balance breadth and focus: too narrow misses opportunities, too broad wastes time.
    - Reference experiment goals: search should directly support hypothesis testing.
  </quality>

  <output>
    - Search parameter document with:
      * Selected platforms and rationale.
      * Complete list of tags, hashtags, keywords, mentions.
      * All filter criteria (dates, media types, engagement, users).
      * Relevance criteria and scoring approach.
  </output>
