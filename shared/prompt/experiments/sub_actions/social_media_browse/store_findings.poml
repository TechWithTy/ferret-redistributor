    <step title="Create Creative Asset Entries">
      - For each reference post/media item:
        * Create entry in Creative Assets Notion database (`<CreativeAssetsDB>`).
        * Upload or link media files (images, videos, thumbnails).
        * Set asset type and format based on post type.
        * Add caption as notes or description.
      - **Metadata Tagging**: 
        * Source platform (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.).
        * Search tags used to find this content.
        * Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, etc.).
        * Author information (username, follower count).
        * Post URL and timestamp.
        * Research session identifier.
    </step>

    <step title="Link to Experiments">
      - Link Creative Assets to relevant Experiments (`<ExperimentsDB>`):
        * Connect assets to experiments they inform.
        * Tag assets with content pillars or themes.
        * Link to specific hypotheses being tested.
      - Update experiment records:
        * Add research findings to experiment notes.
        * Link related Creative Assets.
        * Document insights that inform experiment design.
    </step>

    <step title="Document Research Outcomes">
      - Create entries in Iterations/Actions (`<IterationsDB>`):
        * Record research activity as an action.
        * Document findings and insights.
        * Link to related Creative Assets and Experiments.
        * Note research methodology and sources.
      - **Research Documentation**: 
        * Search parameters used.
        * Platforms searched and result counts.
        * Key findings and patterns identified.
        * Recommendations generated.
    </step>

    <step title="Organize and Tag Assets">
      - **Tagging Strategy**: 
        * Content themes and topics.
        * Platform and format tags.
        * Engagement tier tags (high, medium, low).
        * Research session tags.
        * Experiment or campaign tags.
      - **Organization**: 
        * Group assets by research session.
        * Organize by platform or content type.
        * Create collections for specific themes or experiments.
    </step>

    <step title="Create Research Summary">
      - Generate summary document:
        * Research objectives and scope.
        * Search parameters and methodology.
        * Key findings and insights.
        * Recommendations and next steps.
        * Links to all stored Creative Assets.
        * References to related Experiments.
      - Store summary in accessible location (Notion page, document).
      - Share with relevant team members or stakeholders.
    </step>

    <step title="Maintain Traceability">
      - Ensure all stored data includes:
        * Source URLs and post IDs.
        * Timestamps (when found, when posted).
        * Search query that found the content.
        * Research session identifier.
      - Create audit trail:
        * Who conducted the research.
        * When research was performed.
        * What tools and methods were used.
        * How findings were applied.
    </step>
  </workflow>

  <quality>
    - Maintain data integrity: ensure all links and references are accurate.
    - Preserve source attribution: always include original post URLs and author information.
    - Organize systematically: use consistent tagging and naming conventions.
    - Keep metadata complete: missing metadata reduces future value.
    - Update related records: ensure experiments and assets are properly linked.
    - Respect copyright: store references, not unauthorized copies of content.
  </quality>

  <tools>
    - Notion databases:
      * Creative Assets: `shared/models/creative_assets.toon`
      * Experiments: `shared/models/experiments_db.toon`
      * Iterations/Actions: `shared/models/iterations_actions.toon`
  </tools>

  <output>
    - Stored Creative Assets in Notion with complete metadata.
    - Linked assets to relevant Experiments.
    - Research outcomes documented in Iterations/Actions.
    - Research summary document with findings and recommendations.
    - Complete traceability and audit trail.
  </output>
